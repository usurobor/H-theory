**Expressions**

**H-Ocean**:

1. **Wholeness is unlimited, indivisible, continuous flow.**

   Wholeness is like an endless ocean—boundless, deep, and all-encompassing. It has no edges or divisions, embodying the essence of everything in a seamless expanse where all possibilities coexist.

2. **Wholeness inherently possesses a limitation aspect, allowing it to express itself.**

   To reveal its depth, the boundless ocean forms waves. These waves are the expressions of the ocean’s potential, arising when the limitless takes on form. Limitation allows the infinite to be seen and experienced.

3. **Expression is the singular act of limiting Wholeness through its limitation aspect.**

   A wave emerges from the ocean, distinct yet never separate. This is Wholeness expressing itself—taking shape while remaining part of the whole. The wave is the ocean in motion, a tangible form of the infinite.

4. **Wholeness is expressed through the limitation aspect in two complementary ways:**

   - **In the absolute domain, Wholeness remains unlimited.**

     Beneath the surface, the ocean’s depths are vast and unchanging. This represents the unaltered essence of Wholeness—the eternal foundation that persists beyond all forms.

   - **In the relative domain, Wholeness becomes limited.**

     The waves on the surface are ever-changing forms. They rise and fall, each with unique patterns. This shows how Wholeness manifests in specific, observable ways within time and space.

5. **A correspondence exists between an expression in the relative domain and an aspect in the absolute domain.**

   Every wave reflects the nature of the ocean. Its shape, speed, and power mirror the qualities of the depths below. The finite expression reveals the characteristics of the infinite source.

6. **In the relative domain, Wholeness is expressed as related parts forming a whole.**

   Waves interact and converge, creating currents and tides. Together, they form the dynamic surface of the ocean—a harmonious system where individual movements contribute to a greater flow.

7. **In the relative domain, Wholeness is also expressed as the relationship of parts to the whole.**

   Each wave draws its existence from the ocean. Its energy and motion are inseparable from the vast waters. This illustrates how individual forms are connected to and sustained by the entirety.

8. **In the absolute domain, the unity of these expressions represents the intrinsic unity of the unlimited and limited; they are fundamentally the same.**

   The wave and the ocean are one. Though a wave appears as a separate entity, it is the ocean expressing itself in form. This unity shows that all distinctions are expressions of the same underlying reality.

9. **In the relative domain, Wholeness expresses itself through the balance between these expressions.**

   The harmony of the ocean depends on the balance of its waves. The interplay of calm and storm creates the rhythms of the sea. Balance allows Wholeness to reveal its fullness, unfolding potential into reality.

**H-Music:**

1. **Wholeness is unlimited, indivisible, continuous flow.**

   Imagine a vast silence before a symphony begins—a profound stillness that holds all possible music within it. This silence represents Wholeness: limitless, undivided, and full of infinite potential.

2. **Wholeness inherently possesses a limitation aspect, allowing it to express itself.**

   For music to emerge from silence, there must be notes—distinct sounds that give form to melodies. This introduction of notes is the limitation aspect, enabling the boundless silence to manifest as audible expression.

3. **Expression is the singular act of limiting Wholeness through its limitation aspect.**

   The first note pierces the silence, transforming the intangible into the tangible. This act of expression is Wholeness limiting itself to create music—a flow of sound that we can hear and feel.

4. **Wholeness is expressed through the limitation aspect in two complementary ways:**

   - **In the absolute domain, Wholeness remains unlimited.**

     Beneath every note, the silence persists. It is the constant backdrop—the canvas upon which music is painted. This represents the unchanging essence of Wholeness that remains ever-present.

   - **In the relative domain, Wholeness becomes limited.**

     The notes and melodies are the limited expressions. They have specific pitches, durations, and rhythms. Through these limitations, the infinite potential of silence becomes structured and perceptible.

5. **A correspondence exists between an expression in the relative domain and an aspect in the absolute domain.**

   Each melody reflects the qualities of the silence from which it arises. The harmony and resonance of the music mirror the depth of the silence, showing how finite expressions are connected to their infinite source.

6. **In the relative domain, Wholeness is expressed as related parts forming a whole.**

   Individual notes come together to form chords and harmonies. These harmonies blend into a cohesive piece—a symphony where every part contributes to the beauty of the whole.

7. **In the relative domain, Wholeness is also expressed as the relationship of parts to the whole.**

   Each instrument in an orchestra plays its unique role, yet all are synchronized within the composition. The interplay between instruments and the collective harmony illustrates how individual elements relate to and enhance the unity of the performance.

8. **In the absolute domain, the unity of these expressions represents the intrinsic unity of the unlimited and limited; they are fundamentally the same.**

   The music and the silence are inseparable. Without silence, there can be no music; without music, the silence remains unexpressed. This unity shows that all distinctions are different facets of the same underlying reality.

9. **In the relative domain, Wholeness expresses itself through the balance between these expressions.**

   The beauty of a symphony lies in the balance of sound and silence, tempo and rhythm. Harmony arises when notes are arranged thoughtfully, allowing Wholeness to reveal itself through the equilibrium of its expressions.

**H-Dance**

1. **Wholeness is unlimited, indivisible, continuous flow.**

   Imagine a dancer poised before the music begins—there is no movement yet, but within that stillness lies all possibility. This is Wholeness, a continuous flow that holds every step, every gesture, within it, ready to be expressed.

2. **Wholeness inherently possesses a limitation aspect, allowing it to express itself.**

   The moment the dancer moves, the limitless becomes form. A step, a spin, an arm extending into space—each movement is a way of shaping the boundless flow of potential. Through limitation, Wholeness takes on rhythm and structure.

3. **Expression is the singular act of limiting Wholeness through its limitation aspect.**

   A single gesture, a step forward, is Wholeness in motion. This act of expression is the dance taking shape, a brief moment where the infinite flow becomes visible, only to dissolve into the next movement. Each movement is an unfolding of the whole.

4. **Wholeness is expressed through the limitation aspect in two complementary ways:**

   - **In the absolute domain, Wholeness remains unlimited.**

     Beneath every movement, there is a stillness—the ground from which all dance emerges. This stillness is always present, an unchanging space that holds the entire dance within it, even as the dancer moves.

   - **In the relative domain, Wholeness becomes limited.**

     The steps, the turns, the gestures are the limited expressions of the dance. They create form and structure, each one unique in the moment. These movements are the visible, finite aspects of an infinite flow.

5. **A correspondence exists between an expression in the relative domain and an aspect in the absolute domain.**

   Each movement in the dance reflects the energy of the stillness beneath it. Just as a gesture flows from the body’s center, every step carries within it the essence of the whole dance. The form and the formless are always connected.

6. **In the relative domain, Wholeness is expressed as related parts forming a whole.**

   A dance is made up of countless movements, but together they create a unified performance. Every step, every shift in weight, combines with the next to form the larger dance. Each part contributes to the whole, weaving a complete expression.

7. **In the relative domain, Wholeness is also expressed as the relationship of parts to the whole.**

   Every movement is connected to the rhythm of the music and the space around it. A single step gains meaning in relation to the entire dance. The dancer’s movement finds its purpose in the larger flow, showing how every part is inseparable from the whole.

8. **In the absolute domain, the unity of these expressions represents the intrinsic unity of the unlimited and limited; they are fundamentally the same.**

   The dancer and the dance are one. The movements that appear separate are never disconnected from the deeper flow. The stillness and the movement, the form and the formless, are two expressions of the same Wholeness.

9. **In the relative domain, Wholeness expresses itself through the balance between these expressions.**

   The beauty of dance lies in the balance between movement and stillness, rhythm and freedom. When the dancer moves in harmony with the music, with space, with the flow of the moment, Wholeness is fully expressed. This balance allows the dance to come alive, showing the unity of all its parts.
